**If you have a difficult co-parent, you're in the right place.**

I’m not here to sell you anything. I don’t promise to have all the answers. _No one does._

What I can offer are ideas and ways of thinking shaped by my experience navigating **lawyers, GALs, judges, custody hearings**, and the endless, grinding pressure of a system that doesn’t seem to care who you are—only what paperwork says you are.

If you're reading this, you're probably **exhausted**. Maybe **angry**. Maybe **heartbroken**. Maybe all three.

It’s easy to vomit out the latest **bullshit** your co-parent did, the newest **summons** that showed up, how unfair it all is.

What’s not easy is finding someone who actually _gets it_—someone who can genuinely empathize with the **frustration**, the **loneliness**, and the sick-to-your-stomach **anxiety** that never quite goes away.

Being a **single parent**—being a **co-parent**—is so much more than a title you never planned for. There’s a whole messy, painful story that happened _before_ those titles ever applied.

None of that gets accounted for in court. The system sees a **dispute**. What you feel is **loss**.

- The loss of a relationship.  
- The loss of trust.  
- The loss of stability.  
- The loss of time with your kid.  
- The pain of watching your child cry for something you can’t give them—a home that still feels whole.

_I’ve been there. I’m still there._

And the truth is, there’s no manual. No court-ordered, 4-hour Zoom class will teach you how to hold it together when your kid asks:  
> _“Are you and Mom ever getting back together?”_

No therapist has the bandwidth to fully unpack the **rage**, **shame**, **guilt**, and **fear** that all live in your chest at the same time.

> _"According to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, divorce and separation are among the most stressful life events—ranking right up there with the death of a spouse or a jail sentence. And yet, parents are expected to keep functioning like nothing’s wrong."_

_You're in a special kind of hell._

<p class="callout">There is a way through this.</p>

Not around it.  
**Through it.**

**ParentZero** exists to help map that terrain.  
Not perfectly. Not neatly. But **honestly**.

Every post is a breadcrumb.  
Things that _clicked_ after years of walking in the dark.  
Lessons that came from wounds, silence, and staying when it was easier to run.
