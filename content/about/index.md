There’s a river you cross when you become a parent.  
You don’t know it’s there until you’re already on the bridge.

And sometimes, on the other side… is someone who’d rather see it burn than let you cross together.  

This isn’t a guide.  
It’s not a fix-it manual.  
It’s a record.  

Of what it means to co-parent with someone you don't recognize.  
Of how the ones who suffer most are the smallest ones, the quiet ones.
The ones caught in the crossfire of eye rolls and silence and weaponized smiles.  

You’ve seen it, haven’t you?  
The child who shuts down when you ask about their day.  
The questions they shouldn’t even have words for.  
The way they say “It’s fine” like it’s been practiced.  

And you—you’re the steady one.
The one who shows up. Again. And again. And again.
No matter what rumors were spread. No matter what was twisted.
You stay.  

If you’re reading this, you’re probably exhausted.  
Maybe angry. Maybe heartbroken. Maybe all three.  
I don’t have all the answers.  
What I have are moments. Fragments.  
Lessons that came from wounds, silence, and staying when it was easier to run.  

Being a single parent—being a co-parent—is so much more than a title you never planned for.  
There’s a whole messy, painful story that happened before those titles ever applied.  

You’re in a special kind of hell.  

But you’re still trying.  
No awards. No trophies. No prizes.  
Because you're The parent.  
That matters to your child.  
You understand how critical this time is.  
And they're watching.  

Every post is for someone like you.  
Not the perfect parent. The present one.  

ParentZero isn’t about winning.  
It’s about staying human when someone else keeps trying to turn you into a villain.  
It’s about seeing the ache in your child’s eyes and choosing—not to react—but to respond.  
Because sometimes the strongest thing you can do isn’t to push back.  
It’s to step aside.  
To make space.  
To let your child see—maybe for the first time— 
that not everything has to break.

<p class="callout">There is a way through this.</p>

Not around it.  
**Through it.**

**ParentZero** exists to help map that terrain.  
Not perfectly. Not neatly. But **honestly**.

**Ø doesn’t mean empty.**
