## What is Courtroom Gaslighting?
Courtroom gaslighting refers to emotional and psychological manipulation tactics used by lawyers or witnesses to make a person doubt their perceptions, feelings, or sanity.

3. **Creating Mistrust**: They attempt to make you question your memories or motivations.  
4. **Emphasizing Your Emotions**: They may exaggerate your emotional responses to make you feel irrational.
