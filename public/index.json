The ones caught in the crossfire of eye rolls and silence and weaponized smiles.\nYou’ve seen it, haven’t you?\nThe child who shuts down when you ask about their day.\nThe questions they shouldn’t even have words for.\nThe way they say “It’s fine” like it’s been practiced.\nAnd you—you’re the steady one. The one who shows up. Again. And again. And again. No matter what rumors were spread. No matter what was twisted. You stay.\nIf you’re reading this, you’re probably exhausted.\nMaybe angry. Maybe heartbroken. Maybe all three.\nI don’t have all the answers.\nWhat I have are moments. Fragments.\nLessons that came from wounds, silence, and staying when it was easier to run.\nBeing a single parent—being a co-parent—is so much more than a title you never planned for.\nThere’s a whole messy, painful story that happened before those titles ever applied.\nYou’re in a special kind of hell.\nBut you’re still trying.\nNo awards. No trophies. No prizes.\nBecause you\u0026rsquo;re The parent.\nThat matters to your child.\nYou understand how critical this time is.\nAnd they\u0026rsquo;re watching.\nEvery post is for someone like you.\nNot the perfect parent. The present one.\nParentZero isn’t about winning.\nIt’s about staying human when someone else keeps trying to turn you into a villain.\nIt’s about seeing the ache in your child’s eyes and choosing—not to react—but to respond.\nBecause sometimes the strongest thing you can do isn’t to push back.\nIt’s to step aside.\nTo make space.\nTo let your child see—maybe for the first time— that not everything has to break.\nThere is a way through this.\nNot around it.\nThrough it.\nParentZero exists to help map that terrain.\nNot perfectly. Not neatly. But honestly.\nØ doesn’t mean empty.\nIt means origin…\nWhere healing begins.\nWelcome to ParentZero.\nWe go forward from here.\n","date":"June 10 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"ParentZero","summary":"If you have a difficult co-parent, you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place.
