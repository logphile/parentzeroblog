Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\u0026rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\nWhy do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using \u0026lsquo;Content here, content here\u0026rsquo;, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for \u0026rsquo;lorem ipsum\u0026rsquo; will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\nWhere does it come from? Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.

I don’t promise to have all the answers. No one does.\nWhat I can offer are ideas and ways of thinking shaped by my experience navigating lawyers, GALs, judges, custody hearings, and the endless, grinding pressure of a system that doesn’t seem to care who you are—only what paperwork says you are.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re reading this, you\u0026rsquo;re probably exhausted. Maybe angry. Maybe heartbroken. Maybe all three.\nIt’s easy to vomit out the latest bullshit your co-parent did, the newest summons that showed up, how unfair it all is.\nWhat’s not easy is finding someone who actually gets it—someone who can genuinely empathize with the frustration, the loneliness, and the sick-to-your-stomach anxiety that never quite goes away.\nBeing a single parent—being a co-parent—is so much more than a title you never planned for. There’s a whole messy, painful story that happened before those titles ever applied.\nNone of that gets accounted for in court. The system sees a dispute. What you feel is loss.\nThe loss of a relationship. The loss of trust. The loss of stability. The loss of time with your kid. The pain of watching your child cry for something you can’t give them—a home that still feels whole. I’ve been there. I’m still there.\nAnd the truth is, there’s no manual. No court-ordered, 4-hour Zoom class will teach you how to hold it together when your kid asks:\n“Are you and Mom ever getting back together?”\nNo therapist has the bandwidth to fully unpack the rage, shame, guilt, and fear that all live in your chest at the same time.\n\u0026ldquo;According to the Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale, divorce and separation are among the most stressful life events—ranking right up there with the death of a spouse or a jail sentence. And yet, parents are expected to keep functioning like nothing’s wrong.\u0026rdquo;\nYou\u0026rsquo;re in a special kind of hell.\nThere is a way through this.\nNot around it.\nThrough it.\nParentZero exists to help map that terrain.\nNot perfectly. Not neatly. But honestly.\nEvery post is a breadcrumb.\nThings that clicked after years of walking in the dark.\nLessons that came from wounds, silence, and staying when it was easier to run.\nIf any of this resonates with you…\nYou’re not alone.\nIn code, Ø means null—empty, nothing.\nHere, it marks the turning point: when we stop reacting and start responding.\n","date":"June 10 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"ParentZero","summary":"If you have a difficult co-parent, you\u0026rsquo;re in the right place.
